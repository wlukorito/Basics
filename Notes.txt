--Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript

Node: program that includes Google's V8 JavaScript engine  used to run JavaScript

STARTING

variables - cannot start with number, cannot contain space or hyphen, use camelCase, declare on separate lines, meaningful words
shadowing - varibales of the same name but different scope

variable primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined
variable reference types: object, Array, Function

default value of variables is undefined 



static: type of variable cannot change. If declared as string, it remains to be so
dynamic: type of variable can change at runtime


JavaScript Value Types and reference types
VALUE (Primitives)  REFERENCE 
---------           -----------
Number              Object 
String              Function 
Boolean             Array
Symbol
Undefined 
Null 

Primitives are copied by value, Objects are copied by reference.

Literals
Object -> {}
String -> '', ""
Boolean -> true, false
Template -> ``

//Fundamentals for React Developers
-Arrow Functions
-Spreading [...] for arrays and {...} for objects
-Let,Var, Const keywords and scope
-Destructuring for assignment/cloning
-Classes
-Inheritance
-Modules

//OOP 
-Encapsulation - group related properties and methods: reduce complexity + increase reusability
-Abstraction - hide details/complexity of an object and only show the essentials:
     reduce complexity + isolate impact of change
-Inheritance - reduce redundancy
-Polymorphism - refactor ugly switch/if statements


alt + Up/Down arrow           --- Move line 
alt + Shift + Down arrow      --- duplicate line


Arrow Function
-whenever you wanna pass a function as an argument: then use arrow function.

- a utility class helpful for querying paging information related to an array.



JavaScript is dynamic:
let x = 1; //number
x = 'luko'; //string
